* implemented the character animation that were in the project folder 
* added an indicator that powerups are mapped to keys 1 - 4

* added a base level so that every other level inherits from it 
* added visual effect for both green chilli and red chilli so that the three effects can be activated at the same time

* Changed to "keep aspect ratio" (makes more sense for a 2D game)
